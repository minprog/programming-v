## 1 (Answer the questions with True or False)

### 1.1 Floating point arithmetic behaves exactly like normal arithmetic on real
numbers

**A:** FALSE. Floating point provides only an approximation to real
numbers.

### 1.2 On all inputs, a bisection search will run faster than a linear search.

**A:** FALSE. It has a higher asymptotic complexity, but there can be inputs on which it will run
more slowly. Consider, for example, searching for an element that happens to the
first element of the list.
