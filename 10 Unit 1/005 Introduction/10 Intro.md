We will start our journey by discussing the difference between imperative
knowledge and definitional knowledge, between fixed program and stored program
computers, and finally the definitions of syntax, static semantics, and
semantics. We cover straight line, branching, and looping programs. Other
topics include binary representation of numbers, orders of growth, and
debugging programs.

Python concepts covered in this unit include values, types, int, float,
boolean, strings (str), tuples, dictionaries (dict), and lists. We will also
learn about expressions and statements, especially how to effectively use print
statements in your programs. Other topics include assignment, conditionals,
loops, assert, functions, scope, object models, mutation, and mutability.

By the end this unit you should be familiar with the following algorithmic
techniques: guess and check, linear search, bisection search, successive
approximation, and Newton-Raphson (Newton's method). You will also learn
recursive definitions, problem solving techniques, and how to structure
programs using decomposition and abstraction, including specifications and
parameters.

We'll finish the unit with a quiz covering all material (lectures, recitations,
and problem sets) through Efficiency and Order of Growth.

## Now what?

* First, watch [Lecture 0](/lectures/lecture-0) to find out what Scratch is all
  about. This is the programming environment you'll do your first Problem Set
  in.

* Read [Problem set 0](/problem-sets/problem-set-0) thoroughly and install
  Scratch.

* Make sure you finish and submit Problem Set 0 before turning to
  [Problem set 1](/problem-sets/problem-set-1). Somewhere in
  between, watch your [second lecture](/lectures/lecture-1).

* Start asking some difficult questions! The lab assistants can also help you
  with practical matters such as installing Scratch and Python on your own
  computer.
