# Wordgames

**Notice**: from now on, you are required to format your code
  according to the [official style guide]. If you already submitted
  this problem set, you must reformat your code and submit again!

[official style guide]: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ "PEP 8"

In this problem set, you’ll implement two versions of the 6.00
wordgame! Don’t be intimidated by the length of this problem set. It’s
a lot of reading, but it is very doable.

Let’s begin by describing the 6.00 wordgame: this game is a lot like
Scrabble or Text Twist, if you’ve played those. Letters are dealt to
players, who then construct one or more words out of their
letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the
word and the letters in that word.

The rules of the game are as follows:

### Dealing

* A player is dealt a hand of n letters chosen at random (assume n=7
  for now).
* The player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the
  letters, but using each letter at most once.
* Some letters may remain unused (these won’t be scored).

### Scoring

* The score for the hand is the sum of the score for the words times the
  length of the word.
* The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word,
  multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are
  used on the first go.
* Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth
  3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary

		SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES
		
  that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.
* For example, ‘weed’ would be worth 32 points $$((4+1+1+2)*4=32)$$, as long as 
  the hand actually has 1 ‘w’, 2 ‘e’s, and 1 ‘d’.
* As another example, if n=7 and you get ‘waybill’ on the first go, it would
  be worth 155 points $$((4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, +50)$$ for the bonus of using
  all seven letters).
  
### Workload

Please let us know how long you spend on each problem. We want to be
careful not to overload you by giving out problems that take longer
than we anticipated.

### Getting Started

1. Download and save the [Problem Set 3 code files][1].
2. Run ps3a.py, without making any modifications to it, in order to
   ensure that everything is set up correctly. The code we have given
   you loads a list of valid words from a file and then calls the
   `play_game` function.  You will implement the functions it needs in
   order to work. If everything is okay, after a small delay, you
   should see the following printed out:

		Loading word list from file... 83667 words loaded.
		
   If you see an IOError instead (e.g., No such file or directory),
   you should change the value of the `WORDLIST_FILENAME` constant
   (defined near the top of the file) to the complete pathname for the
   file `words.txt` (This will vary based on where you saved the
   file).
3. The file `ps3a.py` has a number of already implemented functions
   you can use while writing up your solution. You can ignore the code
   between the following comments, though you should read and
   understand everything else:

		# -----------------------------------
		# Helper code
		# (you don't need to understand this helper code)
		.
		.
		.
		.
		# (end of helper code)
		# -----------------------------------

4. This problem set is structured so that you will write a number of
   modular functions and then glue them together to form the complete
   word playing game. Instead of waiting until the entire game is
   ready, you should test each function you write, individually,
   before moving on. This approach is known as unit testing, and it
   will help you debug your code.

We have provided several test functions to get you started. As you
make progress on the problem set, run `test_ps3a.py` as you go.

If your code passes the unit tests you will see a `SUCCESS` message;
otherwise you will see a `FAILURE` message. These tests aren’t
exhaustive.  You may want to test your code in other ways too.

If you run test_ps3a.py using the provided ps3a.py skeleton, you
should see that all the tests fail. These are the provided test
functions:

	test_get_word_score()
		Test the get_word_score() implementation.
	test_update_hand()
		Test the update_hand() implementation.
	test_is_valid_word()
		Test the is_valid_word() implementation.

## Problem 1. Word scores

The first step is to implement some code that allows us to calculate
the score for a single word. The function `get_word_score` should
accept a string of lowercase letters as input (a word) and return the
integer score for that word, using the game’s scoring rules.

Fill in the code for get_word_score in ps3a.py:

	def get_word_score(word, n):
		"""Returns the score for a word. Assumes the word is a valid word.
		   The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the
		   word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if 
		   all n letters are used on the first go.
		   
		   Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3,
		   C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on.
		   
		   word: string (lowercase letters)
		   n: integer (HAND_SIZE; i.e., hand size required for additional points)
		   returns: int >= 0
		"""
		# TO DO ...


You may assume that the input word is always either a string of
lowercase letters, or the empty string `""`. You will want to use the
`SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES` dictionary defined at the top of
`ps3a.py`. You should not change its value.

Do **not** assume that there are always 7 letters in a hand! The
parameter `n` is the number of letters required for a bonus score (the
maximum number of letters in the hand).

Testing: if this function is implemented properly, and you run
`test_ps3a.py`, you should see that the `test_get_word_score()` tests
pass.

Also test your implementation of `get_word_score`, using some
reasonable English words.

## Problem 2. Dealing with hands

**Please read problem 2 entirely before you begin coding the solution
  to problem 2.**

A hand is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The
player is initially dealt a set of random letters. For example, the
player could start out with the following hand:

	a, q, l, m, u, i, l

In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys
are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the
particular letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above
hand would be represented as:

	hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}

Notice how the repeated letter 'l' is represented.

Notice that with a dictionary representation, the usual way to access
a value is `hand['a']`, where `'a'` is the key we want to
find. However, this only works if the key is in the dictionary;
otherwise, we get a `KeyError`.  To avoid this, we can use the call
`hand.get('a',0)`. This is the ”safe” way to access a value if we are
not sure the key is in the dictionary.

`d.get(key,default)` returns the value for key if key is in the
dictionary `d`, else `default`. If `default` is not given, it returns
None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.

### Converting words into dictionary representation

One useful function we’ve defined for you is `get_frequency_dict`,
defined near the top of `ps3a.py`. When given a string of letters as
an input, it returns a dictionary where the keys are letters and the
values are the number of times that letter is represented in the input
string.  For example:

	>> get_frequency_dict("hello")
	{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}

As you can see, this is the same kind of dictionary we use to
represent hands.

### Displaying a hand

Given a hand represented as a dictionary, we want to display it in a
user-friendly way. We have provided the implementation for this in the
`display_hand` function. Make sure you read through this carefully and
understand what it does and how it works.

### Generating a random hand

The hand a player is dealt is a set of letters chosen at random. We
provide you with the implementation of a function that generates this
random hand, `deal_hand`. The function takes as input a positive
integer `n`, and returns a new object, `hand` containing `n` lowercase
letters.

### Removing letters from a hand (you implement this)

The player starts with a hand, a set of letters. As the player spells
out words, letters from this set are used up. For example, the player
could start out with the following hand:

	a, q, l, m, u, i, l

The player could choose to spell the word 'quail'. This would leave
the following letters in the player’s hand:

	l, m

You will now write a function that takes a hand and a word as inputs,
uses letters from that hand to spell the word, and returns the
remaining letters in the hand. For example:

	>> hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}
	>> display_hand(hand)
	a q l l m u i
	>> hand = update_hand(hand, 'quail')
	>> hand
	{'l': 1, 'm': 1}
	>> display_hand(hand)
	l m

*Note:* alternatively, in the above example, after the call to
 `update_hand` the value of hand could be the dictionary `{'a':0,
 'q':0, 'l':1, 'm':1, 'u':0, 'i':0}`. The exact value depends on your
 implementation; but the output of `display_hand()` should be the same
 in either case.

Implement the `update_hand` function. Make sure this function has no
side effects; i.e., it **cannot mutate** the hand passed in.

	def update_hand(hand, word):
		"""Assumes that 'hand' has all the letters in word.
		   In other words, assumes that however many times
		   a letter appears in 'word', 'hand' has at least as
		   many instances of that letter in it.
		   Updates the hand: uses up the letters in the given word
		   and returns the new hand, without those letters in it.
		   Has no side effects: does not modify hand.

		   word: string
		   hand: dictionary (string -> int)
		   returns: dictionary (string -> int)
		"""
		# TO DO ...

Testing: Make sure the `test_update_hand()` tests pass. You may also
want to test your implementation of `update_hand` with some reasonable
inputs.

## Problem 3. Valid words

At this point, we have written code to generate a random hand and
display that hand to the user. We can also ask the user for a word
(Python’s `raw_input`) and score the word (using your
`get_word_score`).  However, at this point we have not written any
code to verify that a word given by a player obeys the rules of the
game.

A valid word is in the word list; and it is composed entirely of
letters from the current hand. Implement the `is_valid_word` function.

	def is_valid_word(word, hand, word_list):
		"""Returns True if word is in the word_list and is entirely
		   composed of letters in the hand. Otherwise, returns False.
		   Does not mutate hand or word_list.

		   word: string
		   hand: dictionary (string -> int)
		   word_list: list (string)
		"""
		# TO DO ...

Testing: make sure the `test_is_valid_word` tests pass. In particular,
you may want to test your implementation by calling it multiple times
on the same hand --- what should the correct behavior be?

## Problem 4. Playing a hand

We are now ready to begin writing the code that interacts with the
player.  Implement the `play_hand` function. This function allows the
user to play out a single hand.

Testing: Try out your implementation as if you were playing the game.
Note: Do not assume that there will always be 7 letters in a hand!
The global variable `HAND_SIZE` represents this value. Here is some
example output of `play_hand` (your output may differ, depending on
what messages you print out):

Case #1

	CurrentHand: acihmmz
	Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: him
	"him" earned 24 points. Total: 24 points
	
	Current Hand:  a c m z
	Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: cam
	"cam" earned 21 points. Total: 45 points
	
	Current Hand:  z
	Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: .
	Total score: 45 points.

Case #2

	CurrentHand: asttwfo
	Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: tow
	"tow" earned 18 points. Total: 18 points

	Current Hand:  a s t f
	Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: tasf
	Invalid word, please try again.

	Current Hand:  a s t f
	Enter word, or a "." to indicate that you are finished: fast
	"fast" earned 28 points. Total: 46 points.

	Total score: 46 points.

## Problem 5. Playing a game

A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one
final function to complete our word-game program. Write the code that
implements the `play_game` function. You should remove the code that
is currently uncommented in the `play_game` body. Read through the
specification and make sure you understand what this function
accomplishes.

For the game, you should use the `HAND_SIZE` constant to determine the
number of cards in a hand. If you like, you can try out different
values for `HAND_SIZE` with your program.

**Testing**: Try out this implementation as if you were playing the
  game.

## Problem 6. Computer word choose

**This is all dependent on your functions from ps3a.py, so be sure to
  complete ps3a.py before working on ps3b.py**

You decide to teach your computer (SkyNet) to play the game you just
built so that you can prove once and for all that computers are
inferior to human intellect. Here, you will make a modification to the
`play_hand` function.

First we must create a function that allows the computer to choose a
word. We have provided the function `get_perms(hand, n)` (defined in
`perm.py`, but usable by simply calling `get_perms(hand, n)`).

Look at the function's specification, which will tell you what it
does.  You do not need to understand how it works, but if you want to,
talk to your assistant.

It is your responsibility to create the function
`comp_choose_word(hand, word_list)`.

Hint: First try to make a legal player, and then worry about making
the computer player better (if you have time).

### Problem 6B. Computer’s turn to play a hand

Now you need to write a function similar to `play_hand`.

Implement the `comp_play_hand` function. This function should allow
the computer to play the game through completion.

### Problem 6C: U & Ur Computer

Now that your computer can choose a word, you need to give the
computer the option to play.

Write the code that re-implements the `play_game` function. You will
modify the function to behave as described below in the function’s
comments.

As before, you should use the `HAND_SIZE` constant to determine the
number of cards in a hand. If you like, you can try out different
values for `HAND_SIZE` with your program.

**This completes the problem set!**
