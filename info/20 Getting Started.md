# Getting Started

We will start our journey by discussing the difference between imperative
knowledge and definitional knowledge, between fixed program and stored program
computers, and finally the definitions of syntax, static semantics, and
semantics. We cover straight line, branching, and looping programs. Other
topics include binary representation of numbers, orders of growth, and
debugging programs.

Python concepts covered in this unit include values, types, int, float,
boolean, strings (str), tuples, dictionaries (dict), and lists. We will also
learn about expressions and statements, especially how to effectively use print
statements in your programs. Other topics include assignment, conditionals,
loops, assert, functions, scope, object models, mutation, and mutability.

By the end this unit you should be familiar with the following algorithmic
techniques: guess and check, linear search, bisection search, successive
approximation, and Newton-Raphson (Newton's method). You will also learn
recursive definitions, problem solving techniques, and how to structure
programs using decomposition and abstraction, including specifications and
parameters.

We'll finish the unit with a quiz covering all material (lectures, recitations,
and problem sets) through Efficiency and Order of Growth.

## Now what?

* Start at the [first lecture](/lectures/lecture-1) to get an overview of what
  to expect in the course.

* Read [Problem set 0](http://py.mprog.nl/problem-sets/problem-set-0)
  thoroughly and start practicing with the IDLE environment.

* Make sure you finish and submit Problem Set 0 before turning to
  [Problem set 1](http://py.mprog.nl/problem-sets/problem-set-1). Somewhere in
  between, watch your [second lecture](http://py.mprog.nl/lectures/lecture-1).

* Start posing your assistant some difficult questions! They can also help you
  with practical matters such as installing Python on your own computer.

* Use the *Check Yourself* questions to verify that you have picked up the
  right things from the lecture. Ask your assistants about anything you don't
  understand! This is the best way to easily prepare for the quizzes.
