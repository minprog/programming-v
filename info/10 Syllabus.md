This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. It
aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can
play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their
major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs
that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python
programming language.

## Staff

The course's staff consists of your instructor and several student assistants.
Due to the size of the course, we can't usually respond to email inquiries
about your problem sets or organizational matters. You are encouraged to speak
to a student assistant or the instructor at the lab.

## Goals for this course

Let's start with the strategic goals of this course:

- Help students (who may or may not intend to major in computer science) to
  feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs.

- Map scientific problems into computational frameworks.

- Position students so that they can compete for jobs by providing competence
  and confidence in computational problem solving.

- Prepare college students who have no prior programming experience or
  knowledge of computer science for an easier entry into computer science or
  electrical engineering majors.

- Prepare students from other majors to make profitable use of computational
  methods in their chosen field.

Programming in Python can be summarized with these six major topics or
objectives:

- Learning a language for expressing computations: Python

- Learning about the process of writing and debugging a program

- Learning about the process of moving from a problem statement to a
  computational formulation of a method for solving the problem

- Learning a basic set of "recipes" — algorithms

- Learning how to use simulations to shed light on problems that don't easily
  succumb to closed form solutions

- Learning about how to use computational tools to help model and understand
  data

Programming in Python is designed to help you become skillful at making the
computer do what you want it to do. Once you acquire this skill, your first
instinct when confronted with many tasks will be to write a program to do the
task for you. Said another way, we want to help you learn to apply
computational modes of thought to frame problems, and to guide the process of
deducing information in a computational manner.

This means that the primary knowledge you will take away from this course is
the art of computational problem solving. Unlike many introductory level
courses, having an ability to memorize facts will be of little help in
Programming in Python. This course is about learning to solve problems, not
learning facts. (This, by the way, is exactly why all exams are open book.)

## Prerequisites

This course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming
experience but a desire to understand computational approaches to problem
solving. Now, by definition, none of you are under-qualified for this course.

Since computer programming involves computational modes of thinking, it will
help to have some mathematical and logical aptitude. You should be confident
with your math skills up to pre-calculus (e.g. differentation, logarithms), but
nothing too fancy.

## Expectations

You are expected to watch all lectures and sections, submit eight problem sets,
take two quizzes, and submit a final project. You are also expected to attend a
minimum amount of lab sessions in order to get you moving quickly through the
course.

## Grades

You will receive a number grade for the course if:

* you've attended lab sessions as agreed upon;
* you've submitted every problem set working and on time;
* you've passed the quizzes.

We are most certain that every student is able to pass the course!

<div class="col-lg-6">

The grade of **Part 1** will be determined using the following weights:

* Problem Sets 0--5: 100%
* Quiz 1 needs to be passed

</div>

The grade of **Part 2** will be determined using the following weights:

* Problem Sets 6--11: 100%
* Quiz 2 needs to be passed

Know that this course draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those
less comfortable", "those more comfortable", and those somewhere in between.
However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end
up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself
in Week 0.

The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined
cutoffs for final grades. Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are
not at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those more comfortable. Each student's final
grade is individually determined at term's end after input from the teaching
fellows. Remarkable effort and upward trending do not go unnoticed.

## Book

There is no course textbook; much of the reading will come from online sources.
However, we do have a number of books available for you to use in the lab. You
are welcome to pick up one of these and read them as a preparation for or
review of one of the lectures.
