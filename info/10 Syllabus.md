# Syllabus.

*Edition: February 2013*

This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. It
aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can
play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their
major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs
that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python
programming language.

## About this course.

Let's start with the strategic goals of this course:

- Help students (who may or may not intend to major in computer science) to
  feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs.

- Map scientific problems into computational frameworks.

- Position students so that they can compete for jobs by providing competence
  and confidence in computational problem solving.

- Prepare college freshmen and sophomores who have no prior programming
  experience or knowledge of computer science for an easier entry into
  computer science or electrical engineering majors.

- Prepare students from other majors to make profitable use of computational
  methods in their chosen field.

Programming in Python can be summarized with these six major topics or objectives:

- Learning a language for expressing computations: Python

- Learning about the process of writing and debugging a program

- Learning about the process of moving from a problem statement to a
  computational formulation of a method for solving the problem

- Learning a basic set of "recipes" — algorithms

- Learning how to use simulations to shed light on problems that don't easily
  succumb to closed form solutions

- Learning about how to use computational tools to help model and understand
  data

Programming in Python is designed to help you become skillful at making the
computer do what you want it to do. Once you acquire this skill, your first
instinct when confronted with many tasks will be to write a program to do the
task for you. Said another way, we want to help you learn to apply
computational modes of thought to frame problems, and to guide the process of
deducing information in a computational manner.

This means that the primary knowledge you will take away from this course is
the art of computational problem solving. Unlike many introductory level
courses, having an ability to memorize facts will be of little help in
Programming in Python. This course is about learning to solve problems, not
learning facts. (This, by the way, is exactly why all exams are open book.)

## Prerequisites

This course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming
experience but a desire to understand computational approaches to problem
solving. Now, by definition, none of you are under-qualified for this course.

Since computer programming involves computational modes of thinking, it will
help to have some mathematical and logical aptitude. You should be confident
with your math skills up to pre-calculus.

## Expectations

You are expected to watch all lectures and sections (but not in the lab),
submit twelve problem sets, and take two quizzes.

You are required to work in the lab for some amount of time during the week,
as agreed upon with the course coordinator. During these hours, the teaching
assistants are available to answer any questions you may have about the
lectures, quizzes or problem sets.

## Grades

You will receive a final grade for the course if:

* you've attended all lab sessions during the course;
* you've submitted every problem set working and on time;
* you've passed the quizzes.

Should you not have succeeded in doing one of those, we cannot give you a
final grade. Still, we are most certain that every student should be able to
pass the course!

The grade of **Part 1** will be determined using the following weights:

* Problem Sets 0--6: 100%
* Quiz 1: 0% (but needs to be passed)

The grade of **Part 2** will be determined using the following weights:

* Problem Sets 7--11: 100%
* Quiz 2: 0% (but need to be passed)

Problem sets and the final project will be evaluated along axes of:

* Scope, 
* Correctness, 
* Design and 
* Style.

Know that this course draws quite the spectrum of students, including *those
less comfortable*, *those more comfortable*, and those somewhere in between.
However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end
up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself
before you took this course.

The course is *not* graded on a curve. The course does *not* have
pre-determined cutoffs for final grades. Those less comfortable and somewhere
in between are *not at a disadvantage* vis-à-vis those more comfortable. Each
student's final grade is individually determined at term’s end after input
from the assistants. Remarkable effort and upward trending do not go
unnoticed.

## Books

There is no course textbook; much of the reading will come from online
sources. However, if one is seeking an additional optional reference, one of
the following texts may be useful.
