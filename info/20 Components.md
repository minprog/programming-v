# Course components

You're on your own through this course most of the time, though we will be,
quite literally, on your side when you're in the labs.

Make good use of the various materials that are in the course. Here's a guided
tour through the important parts.

## Lectures

These discuss all theory that is needed to pass the quizzes. Watch the lectures
before or on your way to the lab sessions, i.e. not during the lab sessions, in
order to be able to spend your lab time programming and asking good questions
about the problem sets.

## Sections

Lectures are supplemented by weekly, sections led by MIT teaching assistant.
Sections provide you with opportunities to explore and discuss course materials
in a more intimate environment.

## Problem Sets

The problem sets are the hard work of the course. You are supposed to work on
them in the lab, where you can ask questions to the teaching assistants.

Problem sets will be evaluated along the following axes:

* Scope, 
* Correctness, 
* Design and 
* Style.

Grades are ordinarily determined by scope × (3 × correctness + 2 × design + 1 ×
style). Scores are normalized across TFs at term's end, so mid-semester
comparisons among students of scores are not reliable indicators of standing.

Although you must submit all problem sets, your lowest score among those
problem sets on which you received perfect scores for the axis of scope will be
dropped when final grades are determined.

## Quizzes

The course has two 2-hour quizzes. These quizzes are "closed-book," but you
may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or
written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

To prepare, regularly re-read your lecture notes and be sure to ask the course
assistants to help you find answers if anything is unclear.
