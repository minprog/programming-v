## Optional Textbooks

A textbook for 6.00 is now available. The book and the course lectures parallel each other, though there is more detail in the book about some topics. The book is NOT required. We will not be referring to it in assignments or depending upon it to cover holes in the lectures.

 - Guttag, John. [Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python). MIT Press, 2013. ISBN: 9780262519632.

If you choose not to purchase this book, you will probably find it useful to buy or borrow another book that covers Python. You might check your local public library's resources, or search online for a free Python text, such as [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) or [An Introduction to Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html).

## Breadth-First and Depth-First Searches

Although two of these are Wikipedia articles, these pages have a lot of information, including animated images showing you what nodes are chosen. Once you understand how both algorithms work, try writing out the order nodes are visited in another graph using both BFS and DFS.
